# HW9-Database
In this homework you will read tweet information about "umsi" and from the user "umsi" from a cache file (or from Twitter if the cache isn't present) and then store it in a database. You will write several functions to return information from the database. 

- See HW-DB.py for more details.
- See twitter_cache.json for the cache data that you will use for running the unittests.

Upload a link to your repository on canvas to submit.
